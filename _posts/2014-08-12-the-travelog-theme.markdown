Welcome to my new blog.

I'll be using this space to blog about all the different things I'm learning and some other things from my day-to-day life.

I'm currently inrolled in the edX offering of Harvard's cs50 introduction to computer science and so I'll also use this blog to keep track of my progress on the course.
